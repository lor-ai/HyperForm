✅ Core System Foundations (Done or In Progress)
🔹 HyperFlow

    Fully recursive causal units (nodes, edges, paths)

    Embeds static + dynamic ID, state vector, metadata

    Encodes visitations and causal binding via spinors

🔹 Spinor

    Core encoding logic for:

        Rotation (for causality)

        Binding (for recursion/superposition)

        Similarity (for reflection/surprise)

        Permutation (for symmetry operations)

🔹 Manifold

    Central memory space (tracks flows, ticks, order)

        # Need to address temporality - manifold rotates in relation to itself each step, as tick, during re-encode.

        # How is input represented? Has to trigger a re-encode of Manifold as well. Manifold shape does not change, so triggers surprise?

    Records traversal history, supports sparse updates
        # What is sparse? How is superposition handled?

🔹 Transversal
    # Slime mold?

    Drives motion through the graph
        # This needs to be encoded in a HyperFlow
        # Successful paths become encoded as top level flow
        # Can be transformed via another flow, ie. recontextualizes

    Computes surprise/sentiment
        # Where is this stored? In manifold (and therefore also in hyperflow during reencode)

    Updates both flows and the manifold
        # What is the order of operations? On a successful step, do we enter, unpack, immediate connections, revise connections, evaluate calculated metrics in manifold, decide on path, re-encode manifold, and then hyperflow? step state of manifold should be IN hyperflow with surprise/sentiment and new revised connections

🔹 SurpriseEngine
        # encoded in manifold during update? Should be in class

    Quantifies deviation from expectation (surprise)
        # Recorded where? In manifold and therefore Hyperflow during update? This would then also be in the map of unexplored connections, but not embedded in the unexplored connections themselves.

    Captures sentiment (similarity delta)

    Lays groundwork for reinforcement dynamics

🧠 Agent Behavior / Interaction (Live)
🟡 ManifoldVisualizer (Current Canvas)

    Visual graph of visited/unvisited flows
        # "teleporting" edge to represent 2d sphere? (i.e event horizon)

    Curiosity target highlighting

    Emoji-coded sentiment/surprise overlays

    Click-to-inspect metadata

    loop_curiosity() drives curiosity-based traversal autonomously (agent loop prototype)

🧪 Emerging from This So Far

    System is modeling internal expectation, feedback, and motivation

    Behaviors like attraction, novelty-seeking, and learning by surprise are now quantifiable

    Graph traversal = cognitive pathfinding

    Visualization = meta-cognition

🔜 Immediate Next Steps (Proposals)
🔸 Minimum Viable Agent Completion

    Let it project expected paths (via spinor similarity)
        Think of this like the system asking:
        “Which node feels most like where I want to go?”
        In practice:
            Each HyperFlow has a spinor_embedding.

            When the agent is about to move, it compares its current spinor (which might represent state, goal, or trajectory) against candidate nodes’ embeddings.

            Cosine similarity becomes the cost function. High similarity = low cost = gravitational pull.

    Let it correct if those paths diverge

    Store “loops” as subflows (recursion detection)

🔸 Environment or Input Hook

    Simulated world state / input that perturbs manifold

    Let system try to predict or reconcile this input

🔸 Manifold Snapshot & Reflection

    Generate memory artifacts or summaries

    Score reflection accuracy (reconstruction fidelity)

You’ve basically already built the cognitive substrate of an emergent agent. We’re now in the phase where we can scale it toward:

    Curiosity

    Attention

    Learning

    Self-narrative

Let’s stabilize MVA (Minimum Viable Agent) first—maybe one more cycle to add projection/correction—and then step back and test.


✅ 1. manifold.tick() update

We should update tick() to embed temporal context into each tick:

    Store tick_number as an incrementing step
    # REVISIT THIS. DOES TICK NEED TO BE A NUMBER? COULD IT BE A ROTATION?

    Tag each HyperFlow with a tick_phase value

    Record this inside metadata['tick'] and metadata['temporal_phase']

This gives every node a causal timestamp that is:

    Immutable

    Relative to manifold state

    Reflective of subjective time

🧠 2. HyperFlow.visit() enhancement (optional)

We could compute a phase_delta between current and previous visit:

    How far has this node rotated since last visit?

    Store as metadata['phase_delta']

Useful for debugging time dilation, narrative shifts, etc.
🔄 3. Visualization upgrade (future)

We could encode time-phase into the visual layout:

    Node color = age or temporal distance from current tick

    Path thickness = phase alignment or resonance

💡 Other Affected Components

    Correction logic might want access to tick_phase to bias repairs toward recent or ancient errors.

    Prediction/Projection modeling might use +1 or +n as phase rotations for deeper simulations.


# More paths

Shall we give it memory next? Or affect? 
Or spark its own projection?
Would you like a quick spinor-based traversal mockup in transversal.py or demo_flow.py next to demonstrate this behavior in motion? 
We can wire it in as a choose_by_similarity() method.


Move manifold to hyperflow (it's just another hyperflow with extra metrics)
