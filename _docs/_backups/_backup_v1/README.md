# HyperForm

HyperForm is a self-reflective, spinor-based cognitive engine and hypergraph architecture designed to model belief, memory, prediction, and agency. It represents time, causality, and semantic meaning through recursive hyperflows and compositional spinor embeddings.

The project aims to create a neuromorphic, causally-aware framework capable of autonomous reasoning, self-correction, and emergent motivation‚Äîwhile maintaining full introspective access to its own belief system, memory chain, and causal history.

## üöÄ Features

- **Spinor-based Embeddings**: Each hyperflow encodes causal direction, certainty, recursion, and semantic similarity as a 5D spinor vector.
- **HyperFlows**: Core unit representing recursive nodes, edges, or entire paths in the causal graph.
- **Manifold**: Stores state of the system; each tick records the belief-encoded snapshot of reality.
- **SSRL Loop**: Implements Prediction, Projection, Connection, Reflection, and Correction using spinor dynamics.
- **Surprise & Sentiment Engine**: Automatically evaluates novelty, resonance, and motivation for memory updates.
- **Temporal Modeling**: Time is stored as spinor phase‚Äîno clocks, just belief frames.
- **Interactive Visualizer**: Real-time graph visual inspection with emoji-coded sentiment/surprise overlays.
- **Autonomous Traversal**: Attention-driven traversal system powered by spinor similarity and curiosity heuristics.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```bash
/core
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hyperflow.py          # Core class for recursive causal flows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spinor.py             # Spinor encoding, binding, rotation, similarity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifold.py           # Persistent state container and tick logic

/memory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transversal.py        # SSRL Loop: traversal, reflection, correction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifold_debugger.py  # Randomized graph generator for testing

/interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifold_visualizer.py # Visualization using matplotlib

/demo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ demo_flow.py           # Example use: construct, traverse, visualize
```

## üß™ Dev Environment Notes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to runtime limitations, files uploaded to this environment can be reset. Always back up `*.py` files and write contextual checkpoints.

Use `demo_flow.py` with a debug manifold for safe SSRL loop testing and immediate visualization.

## üîó Project Philosophy

HyperForm isn't just code‚Äîit's a cognitive architecture:
- No central clock
- No fixed knowledge
- No separation between memory and imagination

Beliefs are encoded recursively, time is phase-relative, and memory is rewritable *only in the now.*

## üå± Inspiration
- Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)
- Spinor geometry and Clifford algebra
- Predictive processing
- Theory of Mind (ToM)
- Phenomenology of belief and memory

## ‚ú® Example: SSRL Loop

```python
manifold = generate_debug_manifold(seed=42, depth=30)
transversal = Transversal(manifold)
transversal.ssrl_loop(start_id=start_id, steps=10)
viz = ManifoldVisualizer(manifold)
viz.draw()
```

See the agent traverse its belief graph in real time.
