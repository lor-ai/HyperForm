âœ… 1. manifold.tick() update

We should update tick() to embed temporal context into each tick:

    Store tick_number as an incrementing step

    Tag each HyperFlow with a tick_phase value

    Record this inside metadata['tick'] and metadata['temporal_phase']

This gives every node a causal timestamp that is:

    Immutable

    Relative to manifold state

    Reflective of subjective time

ðŸ§  2. HyperFlow.visit() enhancement (optional)

We could compute a phase_delta between current and previous visit:

    How far has this node rotated since last visit?

    Store as metadata['phase_delta']

Useful for debugging time dilation, narrative shifts, etc.
ðŸ”„ 3. Visualization upgrade (future)

We could encode time-phase into the visual layout:

    Node color = age or temporal distance from current tick

    Path thickness = phase alignment or resonance

ðŸ’¡ Other Affected Components

    Correction logic might want access to tick_phase to bias repairs toward recent or ancient errors.

    Prediction/Projection modeling might use +1 or +n as phase rotations for deeper simulations.
