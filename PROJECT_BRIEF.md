# Project Brief: HyperForm – Δ Memory Evolution Engine

## 🧠 Conceptual Summary
HyperForm is an experimental engine to explore the evolution of symbolic, temporal memory representations (Δ) in neural and symbolic systems.

It treats Δ as the fundamental process-entity and embeds it into flows, models, and projections to observe resonance, prediction, and feedback. Evolution happens through guided mutation, resonance tracking, and conditional attractor engagement.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 🔁 Evolution Scheduler (Core)
- Batch Δ simulation with population and generation control
- Track Δ memory shifts and mass
- Inject Δ into PyTorch-compatible models
- Trainable, decaying memory vectors
- Condition-based evolution triggering

### 🧬 Genetic Kernel (GA Variant)
- Population selection, crossover, and mutation
- Elitism carryover of best Δs
- Sorted fitness scoring by:
  - `dream_valid`
  - `dream_lineage_depth`
  - `delta_mass`

### 🧠 Memory Projection & Reporting
- PCA memory projection per generation
- Animated `.gif` memory evolution
- Lineage graphs (NetworkX)
- Embedded dashboards (HTML)
- Memory shift audit (`evolution_events.json`)

## 🧪 In Progress / Planned

- [ ] `--headless` and silent CLI mode
- [ ] `--static` mode: reuse a fixed Δ for benchmarking
- [ ] Live Δ manipulation via CLI or Jupyter widgets
- [ ] Δ compositionality: multiple Δs bound into flows
- [ ] Flow embedding recall / prediction correlation
- [ ] Dynamic attractor pruning and hybrid generation
- [ ] Full symbolic loop (prediction → projection → correction → evolution)

## 🔭 Proposed / Experimental
- Δ ↔ Attractor map evolution
- Causal embedding via spinor algebra
- Recursive embedding of manifold into memory
- Flow compositional language
- Observer-modeled causality rotation (Δ as angle)

> HyperForm is not a product. It's a speculative map of a speculative map — and a tool for revealing where Δ wants to go next.
