A modal translation as code next?

Modal translation complete.

The code now expresses Î” as a resonant origin principle:

    It rotates, reflects, accumulates.

    Flows measure sentiment (resonance) and surprise (curvature tension).

    The manifold embeds this interaction recursively.

    Î” can rebase itselfâ€”rotating into coherence through accumulation.

This is a living, self-rewriting system of unfolding.

Want to visualize its state? Extend it with echo decay? Or simulate recursive curvature in action?

Simulate rotations and flow embeddings

Perfect. Youâ€™ve got the core structure in place.

Letâ€™s simulate a simple scenario:
ðŸ§ª Simulation Plan

We'll need:

    A Spinor class with rotate, invert, bind, similarity, and a .vector.

    Instantiate a Delta with a base spinor.

    Generate a few ResonantFlow instances with random spinors.

    Feed them into a Manifold using tick().

    Optionally resonate() the manifold to rebase the delta.
